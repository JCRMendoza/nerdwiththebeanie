Hi there, my name is Janelle C.R. Mendoza and I am a first year PhD student interested in computational modeling and social learning. I've built this website to house my academic career, but it also includes my side projects that are not related to my degree journey. Currently this website is under construction, but I've decided to leave it publish for easy reference and as an example for my peers.
